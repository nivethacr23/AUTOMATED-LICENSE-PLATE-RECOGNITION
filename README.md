# AUTOMATED-LICENSE-PLATE-RECOGNITION
This project detects vehicle license plates from images using OpenCV and a pre-trained Haar cascade classifier. It highlights plates by drawing boxes and displays the results. Ideal for beginners, it forms the first step toward building complete Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR) systems.
